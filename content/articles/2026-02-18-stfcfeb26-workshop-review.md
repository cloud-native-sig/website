Summary: A review of our Kubechaos v2 workshop at STFC Harwell, Oxfordshire

Yesterday we ran our second workshop at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on
the Harwell campus in Oxfordshire. This was a re-run of our Kubechaos workshop
from RSECon25 with enhancements. The updated lesson material can be read at
[https://cloud-native-sig.github.io/stfcfeb26-intro-to-kubernetes/](https://cloud-native-sig.github.io/stfcfeb26-intro-to-kubernetes/),
including contributions from workshop attendees. We had a full room and even
more joining online&mdash;thank you all for interesting questions, comments and
suggestions. We are also grateful to STFC Scientific Computing for hosting us,
and in particular Pam Slingsby for pulling everything together and producing
some rather exceptional promotional material, and Viktor Bozhinov for offering
to help online participants.

If you were unable to attend or perhaps had follow-up questions, feel free to
get in touch with Lewis or Piper. Also don't forget to stay tuned for updates 
from the Cloud Native SIG and the [CAKE fellowship](https://www.cake.ac.uk/ke-fellowships/cohort1). 
We already have exciting plans for our next workshop at 
[Durham HPC Days](https://hpc-days.github.io/Durham-HPC-Days-2026/programme-2026/pocket-sized-tuesday-09-00/) in June!
