# Cloud Native SIG Website
Repository for content and deployment of cloud-native-sig website via GitHub
pages.

[http://cloud-native-sig.github.io/website/](http://cloud-native-sig.github.io/website/)

## Build details

The website is generated by [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) using
the [pelican-alchemy](https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy) theme
with [Bootswatch flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/).
Note that pelican-alchemy is included as a submodule
`themes/pelican-alchemy`.

Site settings and pelican build information is defined in `pelicanconf.py` and
`publishconf.py`. `pelicanconf.py` contains most settings and may be used to
build locally by running `pelican content`  in the base directory of the
repository (`pip install pelican[markdown]` first).
 `publishconf.py` imports `pelicanconf.py` and sets additional
settings appropriate for publishing. In particular a target `SITEURL`
should be updated when setting or changing the custom domain for GitHub Pages.

The workflow `.github/workflows/pelican.yml` calls `publishconf.py` to
perform the build and deploys to GitHub pages.
'GitHub Actions' must be specified as a source in
[Pages Settings](https://github.com/cloud-native-sig/website/settings/pages).

## Content Overview

There are two main content types:

1. Articles
2. Pages

Articles are used for blog-style posts and are displayed in reverse
chronological order on the main page, whilst pages are for more
static information such as 'About' or 'Contact Us'.

## Writing an article

Create a markdown file in `content/articles` with a header
in the form
```
Title: Cloud Native SIG at RSECon25
Date: 2025-09-16
Category: Events
Tags: events, kubernetes, workshop
Author: Shemilt, Laura
Summary: Review of our "Deploying a Web App with Kubernetes: A Beginner's Guide" workshop at RSECon25

<CONTENT>
```
**N.B.** There is no need to start your `<CONTENT>` with a
markdown header; one will be automatically generated from
the `Title`.

Category is the main organisational field such that one can view all Events by
navigating to `{website-url}/category/events.html` (available in the left hand
menu and footer). Tags can be specified as a comma separated list; these are
optional but serve a similar function as Category (see
`{website-url}/category/tags.html`).

Images can be placed in `content/images` and included with
```
![Alt-text]({static}/images/<image-file>)
```



## Writing a page
Create a markdown file in `contents/pages` with a header
```
Title: About
Date: 2025-12-17
Modified: 2025-12-17
```
See `content/pages/about.md` for an example. Pages are currently shown in the
header due to the `DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU = True` setting in
`pelicanconf.yaml`.
